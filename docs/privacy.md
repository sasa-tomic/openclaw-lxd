# Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** January 30, 2025

## Overview

Moltbot Calendar Service ("the Service") accesses your Google Calendar data solely to perform calendar operations you request through the Moltbot automation platform.

## Data We Access

- **Calendar events**: Read and write access to create, modify, and view calendar events
- **Calendar metadata**: Calendar names and settings needed to perform operations

## Data We Store

- **OAuth tokens**: Stored locally in the container to maintain calendar access
- **No cloud storage**: Your calendar data is not transmitted to or stored on any external servers

## Data We Share

We do not share, sell, or transfer your calendar data to any third parties.

## Data Retention

OAuth tokens are stored only within your local Moltbot container. Deleting the container removes all stored credentials.

## Your Rights

You can revoke access at any time through your [Google Account permissions](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions).
